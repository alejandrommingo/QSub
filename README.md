# QSub Library

## Overview

The `QSub` Library is a Python package designed for creating and manipulating semantic subspaces. It leverages advanced computational models to explore and experiment with different aspects of language processing. This library is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners working in the fields of computational linguistics, cognitive psychology, and data science.

## Features

- **Semantic Space Construction**: Utilize models like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), Word2Vec, and BERT to construct semantic spaces.
- **Contour Generation**: Generate semantic contours for given terms within these spaces.
- **Subspace Creation**: Develop and manipulate subspaces based on semantic contours.

## Installation

To install QSub, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejandrommingo/QSub.git
cd QSub
pip install .
```

## Usage

QSub is in its first alpha version. You can find the first use example in our [Conceptual Contour Notebook](https://github.com/alejandrommingo/QSub/blob/main/notebooks/QSub_conceptual_contour_example.ipynb)
